# Overseer

This is a home automation control center/whatever I feel like adding. Currently it:

- Interacts with Hue light groups
- Allows you to back up and download zip files to save bandwidth when multiple people need to download a game from Steam if for instance your ISP caps your bandwidth ಠ_ಠ
- A voting system for anything you want.

Here's an up to date screenshot of the current UI.

And an older gif of the functionality.
