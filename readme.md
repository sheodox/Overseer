# Overseer

This is a home automation control center/whatever I feel like adding. Currently it:

* Interacts with Hue light groups
* Allows you to back up and download zip files to save bandwidth when multiple people need to download a game from Steam if for instance your ISP caps your bandwidth ಠ_ಠ
